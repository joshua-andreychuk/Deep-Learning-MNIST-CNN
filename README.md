# Deep-Learning-MNIST-CNN
# CNN-Based Digit Classification

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to achieve high accuracy and efficient performance in digit recognition using deep learning techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow & Keras** for deep learning model development
- **Python & Jupyter Notebook** for implementation
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib** for result visualization

## Project Overview

### Data & Model
- Uses the **MNIST dataset** (70,000 grayscale images of digits 0-9)
- Images are normalized for improved training
- CNN model with multiple layers optimized for feature extraction and classification

### Demonstration of Proper vs. Improper Training
- The project showcases **the correct way to train and validate a model** by ensuring proper data splits.
- Demonstrates how **improper training and validation can artificially improve performance** due to data leakage.
- Highlights the risks of misleading results when validation data is improperly handled.
- Emphasizes best practices to ensure fair and reliable model evaluation.

### Performance
- **Over 99% test accuracy** achieved
- Efficient training with **optimized architecture**
- Model generalizes well to unseen handwritten digits

## Key Takeaways
- Deep learning significantly enhances digit classification accuracy
- Proper normalization and architecture tuning improve performance
- Correct validation techniques are crucial to prevent misleading results
- Improper validation can inflate performance but does not reflect real-world accuracy
